## Underperforming Segments

## Strategic Observations

1. **Software is outpacing Hardware** — Software categories grew 28% combined; Hardware 12%. 
   Pipeline indicates this trend will continue into FY2025.

2. **Europe stagnating** — 2% aggregate growth. Industrial and Services segments both missed targets.
   Root cause: Q3 EU regulatory changes on industrial imports.

3. **Win Rate improving** — From 62.7% (2023) to 68.3% (2024), driven by better lead qualification.

4. **AOV declining slightly** (−3.1%) — Volume is up but average ticket is shrinking.
   Potential cause: shift toward lower-price accessory/apparel mix.
